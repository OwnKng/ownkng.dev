[Visx](https://airbnb.io/visx/) is a collection of visualisation packages for React developed by Airbnb. The power of visx is that it combines low-level primitives for constructing data visualisation out of basic geometries and scales, while also providing high-level components and functions to handle the more finicky elements of creating graphs for the web - such as tooltips, legends and resizing. This makes visx a highly expressive library for data visualisation, while also conforming with the declarative syntax of React.

I've written a more [extensive introduction to visx](https://ownkng.vercel.app/thoughts/data-viz-react), as well as a post showing how to [create faceted charts with the library](https://ownkng.vercel.app/thoughts/facet-line-chart). This is a shorter post focused on animating visualisations.

In contrast to most other visualisation libraries, Visx is largely un-opinionated on animation. While there is a visx package, [@visx/react-spring](https://airbnb.io/visx/docs/react-spring), that provides animated components, developers are free to bring their own animation library.

As its name suggests @visx/react-spring uses popular React library [react-spring](https://www.react-spring.io/) to handle animations. I've used react-spring on a few projects in the past, but recently I've been using [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/api/motion) more as I find its syntax easier to navigate.

With Framer Motion, it's possible to animate any HTML or SVG element by simply adding `motion` to the tag, like so

```jsx
<motion.div initial={{ opacity: 0 }} animate={{ opacity: 1 }}>
  Fade in
</motion.div>
```

We can add the apply the same technique to our visx visualisations. For instance, stacked area charts can be constructed with visx using the `<AreaStack />` component, which we can provide with children to define our own render functions using SVG `<path>` elements. This would typically look something like the following:

```jsx
const MyAreaChart = ({ data, height, width, margin }) => {
  // chart dimensions, accessors, scales, etc.

  return (
    <svg width={width} height={height}>
      <AreaStack
        top={margin.top}
        left={margin.left}
        data={data}
        keys={keys}
        x={(d) => xScale(x(d.data))}
        y0={(d) => yScale(y0(d))}
        y1={(d) => yScale(y1(d))}
      >
        {({ stacks, path }) =>
          stacks.map((stack) => (
            <path
              d={path(stack)}
              key={`stack-${stack.key}`}
              stroke='black'
              strokeWidth={0.5}
              fill={colorScale(stack.key)}
            />
          ))
        }
      </AreaStack>
    </svg>
  )
}
```

To animate this using Framer Motion, all we need to do is to swap the `<path>` element with a `<motion.path>`, and then provide the initial and animate props.

```jsx
...
  {({ stacks, path }) =>
    stacks.map((stack) => (
      <motion.path
        initial={false}
        animate={{ d: path(stack) }}
        key={`stack-${stack.key}`}
        stroke='black'
        strokeWidth={0.5}
        fill={colorScale(stack.key)}
      />
    ))
  }
...
```

The result of this is that when our visualisation updates with new data, our areas will smoothly animate from their original coordinates to their new ones.
