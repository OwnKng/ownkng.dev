This analysis looks at trends in internal migration in the UK. The data
comes from the UK's Office for National Statistics, which publishes
annual estimates of the number of people moving between each local
authority in England and Wales. It is available to download
[here](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/populationandmigration/migrationwithintheuk/datasets/internalmigrationbyoriginanddestinationlocalauthoritiessexandsingleyearofagedetailedestimatesdataset).

As the data provides an estimate of the number of migrations for each
local authority combination, it's perfect for network analysis. Network
analysis is concerned with the visualisation of relationships between
different objects. Relationships in network analysis are often called
'edges', while the objects of the analysis are called 'nodes'.

The excellent ggraph package is an extension to ggplot that provides a
suite of functions for analysing and visulising networks. Here, we'll
use it to identify the flows of people between between different local
authority areas.

### Reading in and cleaning the data

The internal migration data comes in two separate csv files, which we'll
read in using the fread function from the data.table package. We'll then
bind these two files together.

The estimates provide a breakdown by gender, which we're not interested
in here. Because they're model-based estimates, they're also not whole
numbers - so we add the figures for each gender together, and then round
the estimate to the nearest whole number.

```r
library(tidyverse)

migration <- data.table::fread("Detailed_Estimates_2018_Dataset_1_2019_LA_boundaries.csv") %>%
  bind_rows(data.table::fread("Detailed_Estimates_2018_Dataset_2_2019_LA_boundaries.csv")) %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  # Counting total number of moves by age (including both genders) of both genders
  group_by(out_la, in_la, age) %>%
  summarise(moves = sum(moves) %>% round(0)) %>%
  ungroup()

migration
```

    ## # A tibble: 1,093,317 x 4
    ##    out_la    in_la       age moves
    ##    <chr>     <chr>     <int> <dbl>
    ##  1 E06000001 E06000002     0     1
    ##  2 E06000001 E06000002     1     1
    ##  3 E06000001 E06000002     2     4
    ##  4 E06000001 E06000002     3     4
    ##  5 E06000001 E06000002     5     6
    ##  6 E06000001 E06000002     6     4
    ##  7 E06000001 E06000002     7     1
    ##  8 E06000001 E06000002     8     4
    ##  9 E06000001 E06000002     9     3
    ## 10 E06000001 E06000002    10     1
    ## # … with 1,093,307 more rows

The local authorities are here denoted by their GSS code. These codes
are extremely useful when merging lots of different datasets together,
as the names can often be written slightly differently. For our analysis
however, the place names are more useful - so we'll read in a separate
Excel file with a lookup of codes to names, so we can add these to our
data.

Using the codes to names data, we can also attribute each local
authority to an area of the England and Wales. This is important if we
want to look at migration in a particular region, or merge a number of
local authorities into a single node. Later in the analysis, we'll merge
all the London boroughs into a single node - we're more interested in
migration to London overall, than migration to any particular borough of
London.

```r
local_authority_codes <-
  readxl::read_xlsx("lasregionew2018.xlsx", skip = 4) %>%
  select("la_code" = 1, "la_name" = 2, "region" = 4)

london_codes <- local_authority_codes %>% filter(region == "London")
```

**Migration between towns and cities**

One challenge with the data is that it includes an estimate of migration
or every possible local authority combination, even though many of these
locations will be predominantly rural areas.

What we're interested in is migration between larger urban areas.
Fortunately, Parliament.uk have published a breakdown of which local
authorities are predominantly urban. For our analysis, we'll take any
local authority where the share of the population classified as living
in a city or large town is greater than 70% - this leaves us with a list
of around 100 large towns and cities, which we'll merge into the data.

```r
towns_and_cities <- read_csv("lauth-classification-csv.csv") %>%
  filter(classification %in% c("Core City (London)", "Core City (outside London)",
                               "Other City", "Large Town")) %>%
  filter(percent_of_localauth > 0.7) %>%
  distinct(localauth_code, localauth_name) %>%
  rename("la_code" = localauth_code, "la_name" = localauth_name)

# Merging the towns and cities into the migration data
migration <- migration %>%
  inner_join(local_authority_codes %>% select(la_code, la_name), by = c("in_la" = "la_code")) %>%
  semi_join(towns_and_cities, by = c("in_la" = "la_code")) %>%
  select(-in_la) %>%
  rename("in_la" = la_name) %>%
  inner_join(local_authority_codes %>% select(la_code, la_name), by = c("out_la" = "la_code")) %>%
  semi_join(towns_and_cities, by = c("out_la" = "la_code")) %>%
  select(-out_la) %>%
  rename("out_la" = la_name) %>%
  select(out_la, in_la, age, moves)
```

**Merging all the London Boroughs**

We'll now merge all the London boroughs, and join this back into the
migration data.

```r
moves_to_london <- migration %>%
  filter(in_la %in% london_codes$la_name) %>%
  filter(!(out_la %in% london_codes$la_name)) %>%
  group_by(out_la, age) %>%
  summarise(moves = sum(moves)) %>%
  mutate(in_la = "London")

moves_from_london <- migration %>%
  filter(out_la %in% london_codes$la_name) %>%
  filter(!(in_la %in% london_codes$la_name)) %>%
  group_by(in_la, age) %>%
  summarise(moves = sum(moves)) %>%
  mutate(out_la = "London")

moves_london <- bind_rows(moves_to_london, moves_from_london)

migration <- migration %>%
  filter(!(in_la %in% london_codes$la_name)) %>%
  filter(!(out_la %in% london_codes$la_name)) %>%
  bind_rows(moves_london)
```

### Exploring Migration Between England and Wales' urban areas

To visualise the network, we'll need to build two datasets - one
containing the towns and cities, which we'll call 'nodes'; and one
containing the migration numbers for each combination, which we'll call
'edges'.

We won't look at migration of all age groups - we'll focus instead on
those people aged between 23 and 30 years old. Typically, this is a time
in life when people are more likely to migrate, as they may have
recently finished their education and haven't yet started a family or
bought a home.

We'll also add some other details to the nodes data - the region that
the node is located in, as well as the total moves into the node. We'll
use both of these columns in the visuals later on.

```r
# Creating the nodes data
nodes <- migration %>%
  select(out_la) %>%
  distinct() %>%
  rowid_to_column(var = "id") %>%
  rename("city" = out_la)

# Creating the edges data
edges <- migration %>%
  group_by(out_la, in_la) %>%
  # filtering those records where people are between 23 and 30 years old.
  filter(age %in% c(23:30)) %>%
  summarise(moves = sum(moves)) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  left_join(nodes, by = c("out_la" = "city")) %>%
  rename("from" = id)

edges <- edges %>%
  left_join(nodes, by = c("in_la" = "city")) %>%
  rename("to" = id)

edges <- edges %>% select(from, to, moves)

# Calculate the total moves into each area, and merging into the migration data
moves_total <- edges %>%
  group_by(to) %>%
  summarise(total_moves = sum(moves)) %>%
  ungroup()

nodes <- nodes %>%
  left_join(moves_total, by = c("id" = "to")) %>%
  left_join(local_authority_codes %>% select(la_name, region), by = c("city" = "la_name"))

# Doing some basic cleaning
nodes[is.na(nodes$region),]$region <- "London"

nodes <- nodes %>%
  arrange(region, id) %>%
  mutate(city = fct_inorder(city))
```

To create the network visualisations, we need to convert the data into a
specialist structure which `gggraph` understands. We can do this using
the `graph_from_data_frame()` function from the `igraph` package. The
arguments to these functions are the edges and nodes dataframes we just
created.

We can then pass the network data to the `ggraph()` function to produce
a network visualisation. The resulting plot is pretty, but not
particularly useful - as there is some level of migration between all
the town and cities, every node is connected. We'll want to further
refine our analysis as we progress.

```r
library(ggraph)
library(igraph)

migration_net <- graph_from_data_frame(d = edges, vertices = nodes, directed = TRUE)

ggraph(migration_net, layout = 'kk') +
  geom_edge_link(aes(alpha = moves), show.legend = FALSE) +
  geom_node_point(aes(size = total_moves), show.legend = FALSE) +
  scale_edge_width(range = c(0.2, 1))
```

![](/thoughts/exploring-internal-migration-ggraph/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png)

**Where contributes the most young people to London?**

One way of approaching the data is to look at migration to a particular
location, allowing us to see which town and cities contribute the most
migrants. The code below does this for London, using the 'linear' layout
of `ggraph()`, with circular set to TRUE.

In preparing the edges data, we also only look at combinations of towns
and cities where more 100 people moved to the city in question. This
reduces the number of rows in the edges data from over 3,000 to 182.

Note that these edges are directed, so we can visualise not just
migration to a city, but also migration from the city by setting the
'directed' parameter in `ggraph()` to TRUE and using the function
`geom_edge_fan()`.

```r
ldn_id <- nodes[nodes$city == "London", ]$id

edges %>%
  filter(moves > 100) %>%
  mutate(london = if_else(to %in% ldn_id | from %in% ldn_id, TRUE, FALSE)) %>%
  graph_from_data_frame(vertices = nodes, directed = TRUE) %>%
  ggraph(layout = 'linear', circular = TRUE) +
  geom_edge_fan(aes(alpha = moves, col = london, width = moves), arrow = arrow(length = unit(2, "mm")),
                end_cap = circle(4, "mm"), show.legend = FALSE) +
  geom_node_point(aes(size = total_moves), shape = 21, show.legend = FALSE, col = "skyblue") +
  geom_node_text(aes(label = city), alpha = 0.5, family = "Segoe UI Light") +
  scale_alpha_continuous(range = c(0.1, 0.5)) +
  scale_edge_width(range = c(0.2, 1)) +
  scale_edge_color_manual(values = c("TRUE" = "skyblue", "FALSE" = "lightgrey")) +
  theme_graph(background = "white", base_family = "Segoe UI Light") +
  labs(title = "Sources of young person migration to London")
```

![](/thoughts/exploring-internal-migration-ggraph/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png)

In the above plot, thicker lines denote higher levels of migration.

If we want to do this for other towns and cities, we can create a
function to quickly generate new plots. This saves a lot of copying and
pasting.

```r
plot_migration <- function(city, color = "skyblue") {

  city_id <- nodes[nodes$city == city, ]$id

  nodes_city <- nodes %>% mutate(target_city = if_else(city_id == id, TRUE, FALSE))

  edges %>%
    filter(moves > 100) %>%
    mutate(city_to_from = if_else(to %in% city_id | from %in% city_id, TRUE, FALSE)) %>%
    graph_from_data_frame(vertices = nodes_city, directed = TRUE) %>%
    ggraph(layout = 'linear', circular = TRUE) +
    geom_edge_fan(aes(col = city_to_from, alpha = city_to_from, width = moves),
                  arrow = arrow(length = unit(2, "mm")),
                  end_cap = circle(4, "mm"), show.legend = FALSE) +
    geom_node_point(aes(col = target_city), shape = 21, show.legend = FALSE) +
    geom_node_text(aes(label = city), alpha = 0.5, family = "Segoe UI Light") +
    scale_edge_width(range = c(0.2, 1)) +
    scale_edge_alpha_discrete(range = c(0.2, 1)) +
    scale_edge_color_manual(values = c("TRUE" = color, "FALSE" = "lightgrey")) +
    scale_color_manual(values = c("TRUE" = color, "FALSE" = "lightgrey")) +
    theme_graph(background = "white", base_family = "Segoe UI Light") +
    labs(title = paste0("Sources of young person migration to ", city))
}
```

Calling our function will then generate the formatted plot.

```r
plot_migration(city = "Manchester", color = "red")
```

![](/thoughts/exploring-internal-migration-ggraph/unnamed-chunk-12-1.png)

```r
plot_migration(city = "Bristol, City of", color = "darkblue")
```

![](/thoughts/exploring-internal-migration-ggraph/unnamed-chunk-12-2.png)

**How are different towns and cities connected?**

After we set our threshold for sizeable migration to 100 people, we may
then want to explore how connected the different towns and cities are -
e.g. are there areas which have sizeable migration flows to lots of
other cities, and are there locations which have no sizeable migration
flows?

This is what the plot below shows. London is the centre, as it has the
most connections of any area. We can also pick out locations like
Bristol and Birmingham, which have a lot of connections too.

On the edges of the visualisation, we can see locations like Blackburn
and Hartlepool, which have no connections to any areas - these locations
do not see any sizeable migration of young people either in or out.

```r
migration_net <- graph_from_data_frame(d = edges %>% filter(moves > 100),
                                       vertices = nodes, directed = TRUE)

ggraph(migration_net, layout = "kk") +
  geom_edge_fan(aes(alpha = moves), arrow = arrow(length = unit(2, "mm")),
                end_cap = circle(4, "mm"), show.legend = FALSE) +
  geom_node_point(shape = 21) +
  scale_edge_width(range = c(0.2, 1)) +
  geom_node_text(aes(label = city), alpha = 0.5, family = "Segoe UI Light") +
  labs(title = "Migration of young people between England and Wales' largest towns and cities") +
  theme_graph(border = FALSE, title_family = "Segoe UI Light")
```

![](/thoughts/exploring-internal-migration-ggraph/unnamed-chunk-13-1.png)

**Where are the key hubs of migration across the regions of England and
Wales?**

We can also build a visualisation by region, exploring how
interconnected towns and cities are within a particular refion. To do
this, we'll need to re-create out network data to include only flows
where the migration is inside the region. We'll also lower the threshold
of migration in the edges from 100 people to 50 people.

```r
migration_intra_region <- migration %>%
  left_join(local_authority_codes %>% select("out_la" = la_name, "out_region" = region)) %>%
  left_join(local_authority_codes %>% select("in_la" = la_name, "in_region" = region)) %>%
  filter(!is.na(out_region)) %>% # Removes London
  filter(out_region == in_region) %>%
  filter(age %in% c(23:30)) %>%
  group_by(out_la, in_la, out_region, in_region) %>%
  summarise(moves = sum(moves)) %>%
  ungroup()

nodes <- migration_intra_region %>%
  select(out_la, out_region) %>%
  distinct() %>%
  rowid_to_column(var = "id") %>%
  rename("city" = out_la, "region" = out_region)

edges <- migration_intra_region %>%
  left_join(nodes, by = c("out_la" = "city")) %>%
  rename("from" = id)

edges <- edges %>%
  left_join(nodes %>% rename("in_la" = city, "in_region" = region)) %>%
  rename("to" = id)

edges <- edges %>% select(from, to, moves)

migration_intra_region_network <- graph_from_data_frame(d = edges %>% filter(moves > 50),
                                                        vertices = nodes, directed = TRUE)
```

The visualisation below is very informative. We can see in the East, for
instance, that only Cambridge, Norwich, Ipswich and Colchester have
sizeable migration flows in their region.

In the South West, all locations are linked to Bristol, though almost
all the other locations don't have sizeable migration flows between
them. The picture is similar in the West Midlands, where Birmingham is
the centre of migration but the other locations are generally not
connected.

```r
ggraph(migration_intra_region_network, layout = 'kk') +
  geom_edge_fan(aes(alpha = moves),
                arrow = arrow(length = unit(2, "mm")),
                end_cap = circle(2, "mm"),
                show.legend = FALSE) +
  geom_node_point(show.legend = FALSE) +
  geom_node_text(aes(label = city)) +
  scale_edge_width(range = c(0.1, 5)) +
  facet_nodes(~region, scales = "free", ncol = 2)
```

![](/thoughts/exploring-internal-migration-ggraph/unnamed-chunk-15-1.png)

**Visualising the migration flows on a map**

A great feature of `ggraph` is the ability to create your own layouts.
This allows us, using a shapefile we'll read in now, to place the nodes
on a map of England and Wales and draw the connections between them.

We'll read in two shapefiles to do this. One that contains the local
authorities shapes, from which we'll take the centroids get the lat lons
of each city. The other is an outline of the UK, which we'll use only
for the data visualisation.

```r
library(sf)

uk_map <- read_sf("uk map",
                  "Local_Authority_Districts_December_2017_Full_Clipped_Boundaries_in_Great_Britain") %>%
  select("la_code" = 2, "la_name" = 3) %>%
  st_transform(crs = 4326)

cities_coords <- semi_join(uk_map, towns_and_cities, by = "la_code") %>%
  st_centroid(uk_map)

cities_coords <- cities_coords %>%
  mutate(long = st_coordinates(.)[,1],
         lat = st_coordinates(.)[,2]) %>%
  as.data.frame() %>%
  select(-geometry) %>%
  as_tibble()

uk_map_outline <- read_sf("uk map", "NUTS_Level_1_January_2018_Ultra_Generalised_Clipped_Boundaries_in_the_United_Kingdom") %>%
  st_transform(crs = 4326) %>%
  filter(!(nuts118nm %in% c("Scotland", "Northern Ireland"))) %>%
  st_union()
```

We'll now need to re-create our nodes and edges, merging in the latitude
and longitude of all the towns and cities.

```r
nodes <- migration %>%
  select(out_la) %>%
  distinct() %>%
  rowid_to_column(var = "id") %>%
  rename("city" = out_la)

edges <- migration %>%
  group_by(out_la, in_la) %>%
  filter(age %in% c(23:30)) %>%
  summarise(moves = sum(moves)) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  left_join(nodes, by = c("out_la" = "city")) %>%
  rename("from" = id)

edges <- edges %>%
  left_join(nodes, by = c("in_la" = "city")) %>%
  rename("to" = id)

edges <- edges %>% select(from, to, moves)

cities_coords <- cities_coords %>%
  right_join(nodes, by = c("la_name" = "city")) %>%
  select(-la_code)

cities_coords[cities_coords$la_name == "London",]$long <- 0.1278
cities_coords[cities_coords$la_name == "London",]$lat <- 51.5074

moves_total <- edges %>%
  group_by(to) %>%
  summarise(total_moves = sum(moves)) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  rename("id" = to)

nodes <- nodes %>% left_join(moves_total, by = "id")
```

We can now create the custom node layout using the `create_layout()`
function, passing it the coordinates from the cities_coords dataframe.

```r
migration_coords <- graph_from_data_frame(d = edges %>% filter(moves > 50), vertices = nodes, directed = TRUE)

migration_coords <- create_layout(migration_coords,
              layout = bind_cols(list("x" = cities_coords$long, "y" = cities_coords$lat)))
```

We can then pass this into a call to `ggraph()`, producing the resulting
visualisation.

```r
ggraph(migration_coords) +
  geom_edge_fan(aes(alpha = moves, width = moves, col = moves), arrow = arrow(length = unit(2, "mm")),
                end_cap = circle(4, "mm"), show.legend = FALSE) +
  geom_node_point(aes(size = total_moves), col = "darkgrey", show.legend = FALSE) +
  geom_node_text(aes(label = city), vjust = -0.5, family = "Segoe UI Light",
                 size = 5, color = "darkgrey") +
  scale_alpha_continuous(range = c(0.1, 0.5)) +
  scale_edge_width(range = c(0.2, 1)) +
  scale_edge_color_distiller(palette = "Reds") +
  geom_sf(data = uk_map_outline, fill = NA, col = "lightgrey", size = 0.1) +
  labs(title = "Internal Migration of young people between England and Wales's largest towns and cities") +
  theme_graph(border = FALSE, title_family = "Segoe UI Light",
              title_colour = "darkgrey", title_size = 20,
              background = "#0E0E16")
```

![](/thoughts/exploring-internal-migration-ggraph/unnamed-chunk-19-1.png) We can see from
the above visualisation that a large share of the internal migration of
23 - 30 year olds in England and Wales is people moving to London.

If we want to focus in on migration to and from a particular city, we
can create a function that produces a visual similar to the one above,
but that highlights the edges that connect to the city in question.

```r
plot_migration_map <- function(city, color = "skyblue"){

  city_id <- nodes[nodes$city == city,]$id

  edges <- edges %>% mutate(is_city = to %in% city_id | from %in% city_id)
  nodes <- nodes %>% mutate(is_city = id == city_id)

  migration_coords <- graph_from_data_frame(d = edges %>% filter(moves > 50), vertices = nodes, directed = TRUE)

  migration_coords <- create_layout(migration_coords,
                                    layout = bind_cols(list("x" = cities_coords$long, "y" = cities_coords$lat)))

  ggraph(migration_coords) +
    geom_edge_fan(aes(width = moves, col = is_city == TRUE, alpha = is_city),
                  arrow = arrow(length = unit(2, "mm")),
                  end_cap = circle(4, "mm"), show.legend = FALSE) +
    geom_node_point(aes(size = total_moves), col = "darkgrey", alpha = 0.1, show.legend = FALSE) +
    geom_node_text(aes(label = city, color = is_city), vjust = -0.5, family = "Segoe UI Light",
                 size = 6, show.legend = FALSE) +
    scale_color_manual(values = c("TRUE" = color, "FALSE" = "darkgrey")) +
    scale_edge_width(range = c(0.2, 1)) +
    scale_edge_alpha_discrete(range = c(0.1, 4)) +
    scale_edge_color_manual(values = c("TRUE" = color, "FALSE" = "darkgrey")) +
    geom_sf(data = uk_map_outline, fill = NA, col = "lightgrey", size = 0.1) +
    labs(title = paste0("Internal Migration of young people to and from ", city)) +
    theme_graph(border = FALSE, title_family = "Segoe UI Light",
                title_colour = "darkgrey",
                background = "#0E0E16")

}
```

We can then plot any location we're interested in to identify how the
number and geographic spread of their connections vary.
