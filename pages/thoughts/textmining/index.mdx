The [Science Museum](https://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/home) in London holds more than 325,000 objects in its exhibition
halls and archives, including the world's oldest surviving locomotive,
the first jet engine and the Apollo 10 command module.

The Science
Museum have made available information about each object in their
collections via an
[api](https://www.sciencemuseumgroup.org.uk/about-us/collection/using-our-collection-api/),
which provides details of the object's age, country of origin, materials
and a text description.

In this article, we're going to explore these text descriptions using
the `tidytext` package, and then build several machine learning models
using using the `tidymodels` package. These supervised learning models
will use the description of the object to identify whether it is an item
from the the [computing and data](https://collection.sciencemuseumgroup.org.uk/search/categories/computing-&-data-processing) collection, or the [space technology](https://collection.sciencemuseumgroup.org.uk/search/objects/categories/space-technology) collection.

We'll start by loading the `tidyverse` packages, which we'll be using
throughout our analysis, and reading in the data. I've written a
separate script to query the api and export the descriptions as a csv,
which is [available on my
github](https://github.com/OwnKng/science-museum/blob/main/data-scraping.Rmd).
The computing and space objects are in two separate csv files, so we'll
read them in and then use `bind_rows()` to merge them.

```r
library(tidyverse)

computing <- read_csv("data/computing-data-processing/objects.csv")
space <- read_csv("data/space/objects.csv")

objects <- bind_rows(list('computing' = computing, 'space' = space), .id = 'category') %>%
  distinct(description, .keep_all = TRUE)

objects %>% glimpse()
```

    ## Rows: 2,851
    ## Columns: 5
    ## $ category    <chr> "computing", "computing", "computing", "computing", "computing", "computing", "computing", "computing", "computi…
    ## $ id          <chr> "co408737", "co408742", "co408744", "co409177", "co409514", "co409516", "co409544", "co409546", "co409548", "co4…

The description column in our data contains a text description of each object. These vary in length and format. Two somewhat typical examples are
below. We'll analyse these descriptions using the `tidytext` package.

```r
objects %>%
  filter(id == 'co408737') %>%
  pull(description)
```

    ## [1] "Personal Word Processor by Amstrad, model PCW 8256, with monitor, printer, documentation and software"

```r
objects %>%
  filter(id == 'co433631') %>%
  pull(description)
```

    ## [1] "Model of  Apollo Command Service Module (CSM) and Lunar Excursion Module (LEM) in trans lunar configuration, scale 1:48."

# Text mining with tidytext

[`tidytext`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tidytext/readme/README.html)
is a superb package for manipulating and analysing text data in R,
originally developed by Julia Silge and David Robinson. The first thing
we'll do using `tidytext` is tokenise our descriptions - breaking each
description down into individual words. We'll then remove from these
words any stop words - extremely common words that don't add much to our
analysis, such as 'the', 'and' or 'with'.

In our object descriptions, there are also a lot of numbers. Sometimes these
numbers have a particular significance - such as the year the object was
produced - but often they're an obscure product serial number. For our
analysis, we'll remove any numbers from our words.

```r
library(tidytext)

object_descriptions <- objects %>%
  unnest_tokens('word', description, drop = FALSE) %>%
  anti_join(stop_words, by = 'word') %>%
  filter(!str_detect(word, "[0-9]"))

object_descriptions
```

Once we've done this we can explore the number of non-common words in
our descriptions for each item. There are around 2,750 objects in our
dataset, and approximately 1,000 of them have between 5 and 10
non-common words. A large number, around 850, have fewer than five
non-common words.

```r
object_descriptions %>%
  add_count(id) %>%
  distinct(category, id, n) %>%
  ggplot(aes(n)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 5, boundary = 0, color = 'white') +
  geom_rug()
```

![](/thoughts/textmining/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png)

There are some objects with very long descriptions. We might expect these
to be the objects with greater historical significance, but this doesn't really
seem to be the case. While the Apollo 10 command module is among the
longest descriptions, so are two descriptions for different
versions of the same games console - the C64 and the C64 mini. Many of
the other long descriptions are articles about space meals developed for British
astronaut Tim Peak.

```r
object_descriptions %>%
  count(title, description) %>%
  slice_max(n = 10, order_by = n)
```

# What are the most common words in the descriptions?

One basic question we can ask of the data is what are the most common
words in the computing and space collections. Looking at the
visualisation below, we can see that within computing, 'computer',
'game' and 'model' are the most frequently used words. 'Model' is also a
frequently used word in the space descriptions, though likely in a
different context (e.g. a scale model of a rocket, etc), along with
'rocket', 'scale', 'satellite' and 'space.'

```r
object_descriptions %>%
  count(category, word) %>%
  group_by(category) %>%
  slice_max(n = 20, order_by = n) %>%
  mutate(word = reorder_within(word, n, category)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(n, word)) +
  geom_col() +
  facet_wrap(~category, scales = 'free') +
  scale_y_reordered()
```

![](/thoughts/textmining/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png)

One limitation of merely counting words is that there are some terms which are likely
to be common in each category, such as 'model'. So rather than merely
counting words, we can also estimate the how likely different words are
to be found in each category using log odds.

We can calculate log odds using the `bind_log_odds()` function from the `tidylo` package.[^1] Looking at the graph below, we can see that words such as 'calculator',
'video', 'cassette' are much more likely to be found in the computing
descriptions. We can also see the presence of a number of brand names
that appear in the computing descriptions - 'Apple', 'Nintendo'
and 'Commodore'.

```r
library(tidylo)

objects_log_odds <- object_descriptions %>%
  count(category, word) %>%
  bind_log_odds(category, word, n) %>%
  arrange(desc(log_odds_weighted))

objects_log_odds %>%
  group_by(category) %>%
  slice_max(log_odds_weighted, n = 20)  %>%
  mutate(word = fct_reorder(word, log_odds_weighted)) %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_col(aes(log_odds_weighted, word, fill = category), show.legend = FALSE) +
  facet_wrap(~category, scales = "free")
```

![](/thoughts/textmining/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png)

# How are the words connected?

We may also be interested in which words often appear together within an
object's description. We can estimate this for each group with the
`pairwise_count()` function from the `widyr` package. This code will
return to use a dataset of the number of times every word in our data
appears with every other word, calculated separately within each
category.

```r
library(widyr)

word_pairs <- object_descriptions %>%
  group_by(category) %>%
  nest() %>%
  mutate(pairs = map(data, pairwise_count, word, id, sort = TRUE, upper = FALSE)) %>%
  select(-data) %>%
  unnest(pairs) %>%
  ungroup()

word_pairs
```

    ## # A tibble: 249,653 x 4
    ##    category  item1      item2          n
    ##    <chr>     <chr>      <chr>      <dbl>
    ##  1 computing game       video        168
    ##  2 computing electronic calculator   144
    ##  3 computing cassette   game         131
    ##  4 computing model      computer     130
    ##  5 computing game       published    129
    ##  6 computing video      published    127
    ##  7 computing cassette   published    123
    ##  8 computing cassette   video        116
    ##  9 computing personal   computer     103
    ## 10 computing england    published     95
    ## # … with 249,643 more rows

We can then visualise the connections between these words as network
graphs, using the `ggraph` package. Looking at the network graphs, we
can see that the word 'computer' connects many words within the computing collection, but
that there are also strong links between terms like 'game', 'video' and
'cassette'.

```r
library(ggraph)
library(igraph)

set.seed(42)

word_pairs %>%
  filter(category == 'computing', n > 30) %>%
  select(-category) %>%
  graph_from_data_frame() %>%
  ggraph(layout = 'fr') +
  geom_edge_link(aes(edge_alpha = n, edge_width = n), edge_colour = "cyan4") +
  geom_node_point() +
  geom_node_text(aes(label = name), vjust = 1, hjust = 1) +
  theme_void()
```

![](/thoughts/textmining/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png)

Our space network is somewhat sparser, but we can see that the strongest
link is between 'scale' and 'model'. We can also see links between
'rocket' and 'engine', and 'motor' and 'chamber'.

```r
set.seed(42)

word_pairs %>%
  filter(category == 'space', n > 15) %>%
  select(-category) %>%
  graph_from_data_frame() %>%
  ggraph(layout = 'fr') +
  geom_edge_link(aes(edge_alpha = n, edge_width = n), edge_colour = "hotpink") +
  geom_node_point() +
  geom_node_text(aes(label = name), vjust = 1, hjust = 1) +
  theme_void()
```

![](/thoughts/textmining/unnamed-chunk-11-1.png)

As with our earlier discussion of word counts, there are limits to what
we can infer by looking at pairwise counts. 'Scale' and 'model' are
common words in our space object descriptions, so it's not too surprising that
they're frequently seen with other words.

We might instead be interested in the correlation between words, which
indicates how often these words appear together relative to how often
they appear separately. The `widr` package also provides a function for
this, `pairwise_cor()`, which uses the [phi
coefficient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phi_coefficient).

```r
keywords <- object_descriptions %>%
  group_by(category) %>%
  add_count(word) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  filter(category == 'computing' & n > 20 | category == 'space' & n > 15)

word_cors <- keywords %>%
  group_by(category) %>%
  nest() %>%
  mutate(cor = map(data, pairwise_cor, word, id, sort = TRUE, upper = FALSE)) %>%
  select(-data) %>%
  unnest(cor) %>%
  ungroup()
```

We can then visualise these connections using the `ggraph` package, as
we did before.

Here, we can see in the computing category that the strongest
correlations often relate to particular types of technology ('circuit'
and 'board', 'punched' and 'cards', 'word' and 'processing') or brands
('sony' and 'playstation', 'hewlett' and 'packard', 'intel' and
'microprocessor').

```r
set.seed(2021)

word_cors %>%
  filter(category == 'computing', correlation > 0.5) %>%
  select(-category) %>%
  graph_from_data_frame()  %>%
  ggraph(layout = 'fr') +
  geom_edge_link(aes(edge_alpha = correlation, edge_width = correlation), edge_colour = "cyan4") +
  geom_node_point() +
  geom_node_text(aes(label = name), vjust = 1, hjust = 1) +
  theme_void()
```

![](/thoughts/textmining/unnamed-chunk-13-1.png)

In the space collection, we can see a strong correlation between
several objects related to space food. This is likely because, as we saw
earlier, there were several objects related to this topic that reused a
lot of the same words.

We can also see objects related to particular missions or programmes - e.g. 'black' and 'knight', related to the UK's [Black Knight missile
research](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Knight_(rocket)>) - or the
popular culture space objects, evidenced by the correlation between 'star'
and 'trek'.

```r
set.seed(2021)

word_cors %>%
  filter(category == 'space', correlation > 0.3) %>%
  select(-category) %>%
  graph_from_data_frame()  %>%
  ggraph(layout = 'fr') +
  geom_edge_link(aes(edge_alpha = correlation, edge_width = correlation), edge_colour = "hotpink") +
  geom_node_point() +
  geom_node_text(aes(label = name), vjust = 1, hjust = 1) +
  theme_void()
```

# Machine learning with tidymodels

So far we've explored the descriptions of the computing and space
objects, getting a feel for the terms they use and the substance of the
descriptions. One thing we could do to extend this analysis is develop a
statistical model that predicts from looking at the object
descriptions whether it belonged in the computing or space collection.
We'll fit a few different models using the `tidymodels` package.

[`Tidymodels`](https://www.tidymodels.org/) is a collection of modeling packages that provides a
unified interface to many different statistical modeling packages. In
practice, this means we don't need to remember the idiosyncrasies of a
particular model implementation, but simply follow some consistent steps
using `tidymodels`.

The first step in creating our model is to divide the data into separate
datasets for training and testing.

```r
library(tidymodels)

set.seed(42)

objects_split <- initial_split(objects, strata = category)
objects_training <- training(objects_split)
objects_testing <- testing(objects_split)
```

We want our training process to be as robust as possible, so we'll also
divide the c. 2,000 training data objects further into separate
cross-validation 'folds'. This process breaks our training data into ten
roughly equally sized pieces, each known as a fold. The first fold will
function like a test set in that we'll use it to assess the performance
of our model. The rest of the data will be used to train our model.
We'll repeat this dividing process ten times (creating ten slightly
different models), and then average the performance across all the
folds.

This gives us a good feel for whether our modeling approach is a good
one before we touch the testing data. One important limitation with
machine learning is that our training set is not a good arbiter of
performance - a model built on the training data might [overfit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overfitting),
producing impressive results which are not generalisable when we apply the
model to the testing data. If we use cross-validation, this is less
likely to occur because we're creating ten different datasets to train
and measure our approach.

```r
set.seed(42)
objects_folds <- vfold_cv(objects_training, strata = category)
objects_folds
```

    ## # A tibble: 10 x 2
    ##    splits             id
    ##    <list>             <chr>
    ##  1 <split [1.9K/215]> Fold01
    ##  2 <split [1.9K/215]> Fold02
    ##  3 <split [1.9K/214]> Fold03
    ##  4 <split [1.9K/214]> Fold04
    ##  5 <split [1.9K/214]> Fold05
    ##  6 <split [1.9K/214]> Fold06
    ##  7 <split [1.9K/214]> Fold07
    ##  8 <split [1.9K/213]> Fold08
    ##  9 <split [1.9K/213]> Fold09
    ## 10 <split [1.9K/213]> Fold10

## Writing a model recipe

Now that we've separated our data, let's think about the steps we need
to take before we fit our model. As we're interested in using the raw
text descriptions to predict an object's category, there are a number of
processing steps we need to undertake.

In `tidymodels`, these processing
steps are part of a recipe, which specifies our model formula and all
the transformations we want to apply to our data before we fit the
model. `Tidymodels` comes with an extensive number of functions for
processing text data.

Our recipe involves first tokenizing the data and removing any stop
words. We also stem the words, which reduces the word to its base or
root form, using `step_stem()`. This means words like 'astronauts' will be
reduced to 'astronaut', or 'computation' to 'compute'. This isn't always
necessary, but given that many of our works are plurals or other
variations on more common words, it may help the model identify the
roots within each category of object. We'll also use only the most common 500
words in our descriptions by specifying 500 to our `step_tokenfilter()`.

We don't use the words in our model. Instead, we take their _term
frequency inverse document frequency (tf-idf)_. The idea of the tf-idf
is that it provides a numeric estimate of how important a word is in a
collection of documents. A word that appears in every document, for
instance, will have a tf-idf score of zero, and so is deemed unlikely to
convey anything of particular significance in any one of the documents.
We saw earlier that 'model' is a relatively common word across all of
our object descriptions, so it will be assigned a lower tf-idf as it's less
likely to tell us much about whether the object is a space or computing
object, compared with terms like computer or rocket.

Finally, we down-sample the category column so that we have a more equal
proportion of space and computing objects in our data.

```r
library(textrecipes)
library(themis)

additional_stop_words <- objects %>%
  unnest_tokens('word', description) %>%
  filter(str_detect(word, "[0-9]")) %>%
  pull(word)

model_recipe <- recipe(category ~ description, data = objects_training) %>%
  step_tokenize(description) %>%
  step_stopwords(description, custom_stopword_source = additional_stop_words) %>%
  step_stopwords(description) %>%
  step_stem(description) %>%
  step_tokenfilter(description, max_tokens = 500) %>%
  step_tfidf(description) %>%
  step_downsample(category)
```

We can now attach our model to a `workflow`. A `workflow` in
`tidymodels` bundles together our recipe and the model we're going to
create. The advantage of this is that we can then swap one model for
another one, while keeping the recipe the same.

```r
objects_workflow <- workflow() %>%
  add_recipe(model_recipe)
```

We'll also want to create a null model, which we'll compare to each of
our statistical models. The null model will simply guess the modal class
in our data on every prediction. In our case it will guess that every
object is a computing object - as around three-quarters of our
objects are computing objects, the null model will be right around three-quarters of
the time. This is the threshold we'll aim to beat with our statistical models.

```r
null_classification <- null_model() %>%
  set_engine("parsnip") %>%
  set_mode("classification")

null_rs <- workflow() %>%
  add_recipe(model_recipe) %>%
  add_model(null_classification) %>%
  fit_resamples(objects_folds, metrics = metric_set(accuracy, sensitivity, specificity))

null_rs %>%
  collect_metrics()
```

    ## 3 spec     binary     0        10 0        Preprocessor1_Model1

## A naive Bayes model

Let's start with a naive Bayes model, which are often good at making
predictions from text data due to their ability to accommodate a large
number of features. Naive Bayes models are commonly used to identify
spam email, for instance.

Fitting a naive Bayes model with `tidymodels` is very simple, we simply
call the `naive_Bayes()` function and specify our mode (in our case
classification). Then we add our model to our model workflow.

```r
library(discrim)

nb_spec <- naive_Bayes() %>%
  set_mode('classification') %>%
  set_engine('naivebayes')

objects_workflow <- objects_workflow %>%
  add_model(nb_spec)

objects_workflow
```

    ## Naive Bayes Model Specification (classification)
    ##
    ## Computational engine: naivebayes

Now we can fit the model onto our cross-validated folds. We'll use
several metrics to evaluate performance - accuracy, which is the
percentage of objects we identify correctly; sensitivity, which is the
number of correct predictions for 'computing' divided by the number of
computing objects; and specificity, which is the number of correct
predictions for 'space' objects divided by the actual number of space
objects.

Our naive Bayes model performs just as badly as our null model. Like our
null model, it seems to optimise by simply predicting that everything is a
computing object. It therefore has a sensitivity of 1, because it
correctly identifies all the computing objects, but a specificity of
rate of 0, because it never predicts that any object belongs in the
space collection.

```r
nb_model <- fit_resamples(
  objects_workflow,
  objects_folds,
  metrics = metric_set(accuracy, sensitivity, specificity)
)

collect_metrics(nb_model)
```

    ## # A tibble: 3 x 6
    ##   .metric  .estimator  mean     n  std_err .config
    ##   <chr>    <chr>      <dbl> <int>    <dbl> <fct>
    ## 1 accuracy binary     0.749    10 0.000507 Preprocessor1_Model1
    ## 2 sens     binary     1        10 0        Preprocessor1_Model1
    ## 3 spec     binary     0        10 0        Preprocessor1_Model1

## A Random Forest Model

Let's try a random forest model, which can also accommodate a large
number of variables. To do this, we simply create a new model
specification and update our workflow.

```r
rf_spec <- rand_forest(trees = 1000) %>%
  set_engine("randomForest") %>%
  set_mode("classification")

objects_workflow <- objects_workflow %>%
  update_recipe(model_recipe) %>%
  update_model(rf_spec)
```

We can then fit this model to our resamples and evaluate its
performance. Note that one of the disadvantages of a random forest model
with so many variables fitted over 10 folds is that it's computationally
very expensive. For this reason, we use
`doParallel::registerDoParallel()` to run the model fitting on several
cores at the same time.

The random forest model performs excellently - correctly identifying 95%
of our objects, and achieving a sensitivity and specificity rate of 97%
and 90% respectively.

```r
doParallel::registerDoParallel()

set.seed(2021)

rf_model <- fit_resamples(
  objects_workflow,
  objects_folds,
  metrics = metric_set(accuracy, sensitivity, specificity)
)

rf_model %>%
  collect_metrics()
```

    ## # A tibble: 3 x 6
    ##   .metric  .estimator  mean     n std_err .config
    ##   <chr>    <chr>      <dbl> <int>   <dbl> <fct>
    ## 1 accuracy binary     0.953    10 0.00455 Preprocessor1_Model1
    ## 2 sens     binary     0.971    10 0.00409 Preprocessor1_Model1
    ## 3 spec     binary     0.898    10 0.0150  Preprocessor1_Model1

## A Support-Vector Machine Model

Although the random forest results were very promising, we might just
want to compare them to another model. This time we'll use a
Support-Vector Machine model (SVM).

SVMs are mathematically very complicated, but can be reasonably well understood with a simple
heuristic. An SVM attempts to identify a boundary (known as a
hyperplane) which separates data into fairly homogeneous groups. In a
two dimensional space, this can be understood as a straight line drawn
over a set of x and y coordinates that divides a number of points into two
camps, with each camp representing something meaningful in the data.

In practice, SVMs can partition data over many different dimensions and
can also be tweaked to adjust their operations when a clean split
between groups in the data isn't possible (something we'll get to
later).

We'll first create a spec, and then update our `objects_workflow` with
the new model.

```r
svm_spec <- svm_rbf() %>%
  set_mode("classification") %>%
  set_engine("liquidSVM")

objects_workflow <- objects_workflow %>%
  update_model(svm_spec)
```

We can then fit this model to our resamples and evaluate its performance.

```r
doParallel::registerDoParallel()

set.seed(2021)

svm_rs <- fit_resamples(
  objects_workflow,
  objects_folds,
  metrics = metric_set(accuracy, sensitivity, specificity),
)
```

Our SVM model performs almost as well as our random forest model in
terms of accuracy and sensitivity, and actually performs better at
correctly identifying our space objects.

```r
svm_rs_metrics <- collect_metrics(svm_rs)

svm_rs_metrics
```

    ## # A tibble: 3 x 6
    ##   .metric  .estimator  mean     n std_err .config
    ##   <chr>    <chr>      <dbl> <int>   <dbl> <fct>
    ## 1 accuracy binary     0.927    10 0.00712 Preprocessor1_Model1
    ## 2 sens     binary     0.929    10 0.00740 Preprocessor1_Model1
    ## 3 spec     binary     0.918    10 0.0169  Preprocessor1_Model1

### Tuning our SVM Model

One way we could try and boost the SVM's performance further is by
tuning some of its parameters. In our SVM model, there are two
parameters we might want to tune.

First, the cost parameter. The cost parameter is used to adjust a
penalty that's applied to the model when our hyperplane can't neatly
separate our data into meaningful camps. The greater the cost parameter,
the harder the model will try to achieve total separation. While it may
sound like a higher cost is always better, it's important to
recognise that optimising too much to our training data will possibly result
in worse performance on our testing data as our model won't generalise
well.

Second, the sigma (often also referred to as the gamma). The sigma
determines the influence that each observation may exert on where the
hyperplane is placed.

We can easily identify the optimal values for these parameters using a tuning grid.
First, we'll create a new SVM model spec where we'll state that we want
to tune the `cost` and `rbf_sigma` parameters.

```r
svm_spec_tuned <- svm_rbf(cost = tune(), rbf_sigma = tune()) %>%
  set_mode('classification') %>%
  set_engine('liquidSVM')

objects_workflow <- objects_workflow %>%
  update_model(svm_spec_tuned)
```

We'll now generate a grid of these parameters. `Tidymodels`
provides functions to help us select sensible values for each. We'll set
levels equal to five, so that we are given five cost values and five
sigma values. The grid combine each value, giving us 25 different values
pairs of cost and sigma to try.

```r
param_grid <- grid_regular(cost(), rbf_sigma(), levels = 5)
```

We'll now fit 25 different models (each with a different set of parameters)
onto ten different training folds - in effect, we're about to fit 250
models. Again, because of the computation involved, we'll set up
parallel processing.

```r
doParallel::registerDoParallel()

set.seed(2021)

tune_rs <- tune_grid(
  objects_workflow,
  objects_folds,
  grid = param_grid,
  metrics = metric_set(accuracy, sensitivity, specificity),
  control = control_resamples(save_pred = TRUE)
)
```

We can then collect the performance metrics and identify which parameter
set produced the best results. Our model with the lowest cost parameter
and a sigma of one performed the best. Even this model, however, doesn't
quite achieve the performance seen on our earlier random forest model.

```r
show_best(tune_rs, metric = "accuracy")
```

    ## # A tibble: 5 x 8
    ##        cost rbf_sigma .metric  .estimator  mean     n std_err .config
    ##       <dbl>     <dbl> <chr>    <chr>      <dbl> <int>   <dbl> <fct>
    ## 1  0.000977         1 accuracy binary     0.919    10 0.00600 Preprocessor1_Model21
    ## 2  0.0131           1 accuracy binary     0.354    10 0.00956 Preprocessor1_Model22
    ## 3  0.177            1 accuracy binary     0.331    10 0.00855 Preprocessor1_Model23
    ## 4  2.38             1 accuracy binary     0.331    10 0.00855 Preprocessor1_Model24
    ## 5 32                1 accuracy binary     0.331    10 0.00855 Preprocessor1_Model25

### Finalising our model

We've now used three different types of model and identified that our random forest model appears to be the best performing one. Let's finalise our model and apply it to our testing data.
We'll first revert our workflow back to using the random forest
specification we defined earlier.

```r
objects_workflow <- objects_workflow %>%
  update_model(rf_spec)
```

We now use the `last_fit()` function to construct the model using our
full training set, and then fit the model to our testing set.

```r
final_res <- objects_workflow %>%
  last_fit(objects_split, metrics = metric_set(accuracy, sensitivity, specificity))
```

The model performs extremely well on the testing set, achieving an
accuracy of 96%. It correctly identifies 97% of the computing objects,
and 91% of the space objects.

```r
final_res_metrics <- collect_metrics(final_res)
final_res_metrics
```

    ## # A tibble: 3 x 4
    ##   .metric  .estimator .estimate .config
    ##   <chr>    <chr>          <dbl> <fct>
    ## 1 accuracy binary         0.961 Preprocessor1_Model1
    ## 2 sens     binary         0.976 Preprocessor1_Model1
    ## 3 spec     binary         0.916 Preprocessor1_Model1

Now that we have our final model fit, we can also examine the importance
of different variables in our model. We do this using the `vip` package,
which provides functions for calculating the importance of variables
across many types of machine learning algorithms.

Looking at the figure
below, we can see some of the most important variables to our model - the tf-idf
scores of the words 'compute', 'rocket', 'satellite', 'scale' and
'game'. We might infer from this that descriptions which feature these
words or related ones are relatively easy for our model to classify
correctly.

```r
library(vip)

final_res %>%
  pluck('.workflow', 1) %>%
  pull_workflow_fit() %>%
  vip(num_features = 20)
```

We can also take a closer look at incorrect predictions. There's nothing
in these that seems particularly striking, other than some of these
contain terms that are likely to be found in both the space and computer
collections, such as the description of 'Flown NASA Shuttle Main
Guidance computer, IBM 1980's'. Perhaps even a human would struggle to
place this in the correct collection.

```r
incorrect_preds <- collect_predictions(final_res) %>%
  filter(.pred_class != category) %>%
  pull(.row)

objects[incorrect_preds, ] %>%
  pull(description)
```

In this analysis we've performed some fairly advanced techniques for
analysing and modelling text data, including fitting three machine
learning models to identify which collection different items from the
Science Museum belong to.

The two packages we used most to do this,
`tidyText` and `tidymodels`, provide intuitive and easy-to-understand
interfaces to these complicated areas of data analytics and machine learning.
There are some great resources available on these packages, I would
recommend looking at [Text Minding with
R](https://www.tidytextmining.com/), [Supervised Machine Learning for
Text Analysis in R](https://smltar.com/) and Julia Silge's fantastic
[YouTube
channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTTBgWyJl2HrrhQOOc710kA).
