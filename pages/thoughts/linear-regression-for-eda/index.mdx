This analysis applies linear regression to data on house prices in
England and Wales. It is intended to demonstrate that fitting simple
models to a dataset can be a highly effective way of quickly identifying
trends and generating ideas for further analysis.

# How have house prices in England and Wales changed since 2008?

Data on median property prices in England and Wales is published
quarterly by the UK's Office for National Statistics, using data from
the Land Registry. It is available
[here](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/housing/datasets/medianhousepricefornationalandsubnationalgeographiesquarterlyrollingyearhpssadataset09)

The Excel document contains house prices for different administrative
geographies of England and Wales, and different types of property. In
this analysis, we will look at house prices in the final quarter of each
year since 2008 across c. 350 local authority areas in England and
Wales.

We'll start by reading in the data and do some basic cleaning.

```r
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
library(lubridate)

house_prices <- read_xls("hpssadataset9medianpricepaidforadministrativegeographies.xls",
         sheet = "2a", skip = 6) %>%
  # Converting the data from 'wide' to long
  gather(key = "date", value = "median_price", -1, -2, -3, -4) %>%
  # Converting date to a date format using the myd() function from the lubridate package
  filter(str_detect(date, "Dec")) %>%
  mutate(year = readr::parse_number(date)) %>%
  # Looking at data since 2008
  filter(year >= 2008) %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  select(-region_country_code, -date)

# Clean data
house_prices
```

# Visualising changes to house prices

Let's quickly graph the changes to house prices.

```r
library(scales)

house_prices %>%
  ggplot(aes(year, median_price)) +
  geom_line(aes(group = local_authority_name), alpha = 0.2) +
  geom_smooth() +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = dollar_format(prefix = "£")) +
  labs(x = "", y = "Median house prices")
```

```r
house_prices %>%
  ggplot(aes(year, median_price)) +
  geom_line(aes(group = local_authority_name), alpha = 0.2) +
  geom_smooth() +
  scale_y_continuous(trans = "log10", labels = dollar_format(prefix = "£")) +
  annotation_logticks(side = "l") +
  labs(x = "", y = "Median house prices (log scale)")
```

At first glance it appears that house prices have been steadily rising
across England and Wales, though at very different rates. There is too
much data (even in this relatively small dataset) to easily identify any
key takeaways - so we need to find a way of summarising the data.

# Fitting a (simple) model

One way of summarising the data is to fit a model that captures the
general trend. Since what we're interested in is how house prices have
changed since 2008, we should try to fit a model that can capture the
variation over time. It would also be interesting to look at whether
local authorities that are close together have experienced similar
trends in house price changes.

It's generally better during an exploratory exercise to start with a
simple model, and then expand. The first thing we'll do is visualise
what a simple linear model would look like when applied to one local
authority - here, we'll used Ealing in West London. This model only uses
the passage of time to predict house prices - it is not a sophisticated
model, but merely captures the trend in how house prices have changed
over time.

```r
house_prices %>%
  filter(local_authority_name == "Ealing") %>%
  ggplot(aes(year, median_price)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = dollar_format(prefix = "£")) +
  labs(y = "Median Price")
```

    ## `geom_smooth()` using formula 'y ~ x'

![](/thoughts/linear-regression/unnamed-chunk-13-1.png)

This model does a reasonable job of summarising the overall trend in
house prices in Ealing, with the blue fitted line generally close to the
black line showing house price data. Now let's see how well this
approach scales to c. 350 local authorities.

# Fitting 348 (simple) models

We'll use the nested dataframe work flow to split our data into separate
datasets - one for each local authority. We'll then fit the same linear
regression model to each one, and calculate a couple of summary measures
to compare the quality and findings of the model. Note that for this
model we'll log transform the median prices to base 2. This flattens out
some of the variation in the prices data, and means our resulting
coefficients can (after some transformation) be interpreted as the
estimated annual percentage change in house prices.

```r
library(modelr)
library(broom)
library(scales)

house_prices_model <- house_prices %>%
  mutate(year_since_08 = year-2008) %>%
  group_by(region_country_name, local_authority_name, local_authority_name) %>%
  nest() %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  mutate(price_model = map(data,
                           ~ lm(log2(.$median_price) ~ .$year_since_08, data = .))) %>%
  mutate(model_summary = map(price_model, glance),
         tidy_model = map(price_model, tidy))
```

# How good are the models?

We'll use R squared to assess how good our models are. Broadly, an R
squared of 1 indicates a perfect fit, while 0 indicates a very poor fit
and a model with no explanatory power.

```r
model_summary <- house_prices_model %>%
  unnest(model_summary) %>%
  select(-data, -price_model) %>%
  janitor::clean_names()

model_summary %>%
  ggplot(aes(fct_reorder(region_country_name, r_squared),
             r_squared, col = region_country_name)) +
  geom_boxplot(outlier.shape = NULL, varwidth = TRUE) +
  geom_jitter(alpha = 0.5) +
  coord_flip() +
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  labs(x = "", y = "R Square")
```

![](/thoughts/linear-regression/unnamed-chunk-15-1.png)

Here we can see that locations in London, the South East and the East
have the highest R squared, which means the models work well here. The
fit is likely to look like the graph for Ealing above.

We can visualise what higher levels of R square indicate in terms of
trends in the data. Below, we've 'cut' r squared into 5 equally-spaced
groups. We can see that areas with higher levels of R square have seen
faster rates of house price growth. In locations where R squared is very
low, house prices have barely moved at all or have been very volatile.

```r
house_prices %>%
  inner_join(model_summary) %>%
  mutate(r_squared_cut = cut_width(r_squared, 0.2, boundary = 0)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(year, median_price)) +
  geom_line(aes(col = r_squared_cut, group = local_authority_name), alpha = 0.5, show.legend = FALSE) +
  geom_smooth() +
  facet_wrap(~r_squared_cut, nrow = 1) +
  scale_y_continuous(trans = "log10", labels = dollar_format(prefix = "£")) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(2008, 2018, 4)) +
  labs(x = "", y = "Median Price (£)")
```

# Interpreting the results

We can transform the results of the models to assess how much house
prices have changed since 2008 in different parts of England and Wales.
The transformed coefficients of our model (see code below) can be
interpreted as estimated annual % change in house prices since 2008.

```r
model_tidy <- house_prices_model %>%
  unnest(tidy_model) %>%
  select(-std.error, -statistic, -p.value) %>%
  spread(term, value = estimate) %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  mutate_at(vars("year_since_08","intercept"), ~ 2^.) %>%
  mutate(year_since_08 = year_since_08-1) %>%
  inner_join(model_summary)

model_tidy %>%
  arrange(intercept) %>%
  ggplot(aes(r_squared, year_since_08, fill = region_country_name)) +
  geom_point(aes(size = intercept), shape = 21, alpha = 0.5) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = percent) +
  labs(x = "R square", y = "Estimated annual increases in house prices (%)")
```

![](/thoughts/linear-regression/unnamed-chunk-17-1.png)

Here, we can see that locations in London, the East and the East
Midlands have seen the biggest increases to house prices. The model fit
in these locations, as measured by R squared, is also very high.

We can visualise what this means in practise by adding the predictions
back into the data. As we can see below, the predicted values for Tower
Hamlets (a borough in East London) closely track the median house
prices.

```r
model_tidy %>%
  filter(local_authority_name == "Tower Hamlets") %>%
  select(local_authority_name, data, price_model) %>%
  mutate(predictions = map2(data, price_model, add_predictions, var = "price_pred")) %>%
  unnest(predictions) %>%
  mutate(price_pred = 2 ^ price_pred) %>%
  ggplot(aes(year, price_pred)) +
  geom_line(col = "blue", linetype = "dashed") +
  geom_point(aes(y = median_price)) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = dollar_format(prefix = "£")) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(2008, 2018, 2)) +
  labs(x = "", y = "",
       title = "Actual and predicted median house prices in Tower Hamlets, 2008 - 2018")
```

We can dig deeper into the variation in model performance by region by
faceting our earlier visualisation. Below, we can see that almost
everywhere in London has experienced more than 6% annual increases in
house prices since 2008, while in the East and South East more than half
of locations have experienced more than 5% annual increases.

Most locations in the East Midlands, South West and West Midlands have
experienced between 2.5% and 5%.

In Yorkshire, the North West, North East and Wales, the coefficients are
lower and model performance worse - likely indicating that house price
growth has been slower or more volatile.

```r
model_tidy %>%
  mutate(region_country_name =
           fct_reorder(region_country_name, -year_since_08, .fun = median)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(r_squared, year_since_08, fill = region_country_name)) +
  geom_point(shape = 21, alpha = 0.5) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = percent) +
  facet_wrap(~region_country_name, nrow = 2) +
  labs(x = "R square", y = "Estimated annual increases in house prices (%)") +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```

![](/thoughts/linear-regression/unnamed-chunk-19-1.png)

We can examine the differences in performance within Wales if we
pull-out some of the 'best' and 'worst' fitting locations. While the
best fitting locations have undoubtedly seen slower growth than those in
London and the South East, they have seen some growth. However, areas
where the model fits badly have seen almost no growth in house prices
over the last decade.

```r
wales_best <- model_tidy %>%
  filter(region_country_name == "Wales") %>%
  arrange(desc(r_squared)) %>%
  head(5)

wales_worst <- model_tidy %>%
  filter(region_country_name == "Wales") %>%
  arrange(desc(r_squared)) %>%
  tail(5)

wales_modlels <- bind_rows(list("best" = wales_best, "worst" = wales_worst), .id = "fit_quality")

house_prices %>%
  inner_join(wales_modlels) %>%
  ggplot(aes(year, median_price)) +
  geom_line(aes(group = local_authority_name, col = fit_quality), show.legend = FALSE) +
  geom_smooth() +
  facet_wrap(~fit_quality) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = dollar_format(prefix = "£")) +
  labs(x = "", y = "Median House Prices",
       title = "Median House Prices (2008 vs 2018) in Best and Worst Fitting Areas in Wales") +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```

```r
house_prices %>%
  inner_join(wales_modlels) %>%
  filter(year %in% c(2008, 2018)) %>%

  geom_line(aes(group = local_authority_name)) +
